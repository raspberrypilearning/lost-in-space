## ループを使ったアニメーション

宇宙船を動かすには、別の方法もあります。それは何度も、少しずつ動くように宇宙船に教えることです。

+ Delete the `glide` block from your code by right-clicking on it and clicking **delete**. You can also delete code by dragging it off the Script area and back into the Code blocks area.

+ Can you use a `repeat` block to move your spaceship towards the Earth?
    
    Test and save: Your spaceship should move towards the Earth exactly as before, this time using a `repeat` block.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- Instead of **gliding**, your spaceship should **repeatedly** **move** a few steps at a time. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you'll need: ![Blocks for an animated spaceship](images/space-repeat-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here's the code to animate your spaceship: ![Code for an animated spaceship](images/space-repeat-code.png) (You can use different numbers in the `repeat` and `move` blocks, as long as the spaceship still gets to Earth!) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---

+ Can you code your spaceship to change colour as it moves towards Earth?
    
    Test and save.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- Your spaceship should **change colour** as it moves. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here is the extra code block you'll need: ![Block for changing colour](images/space-colour-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here's the code to change your spaceship's colour: ![Code for an animated spaceship](images/space-colour-code.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---

+ Can you make your spaceship get smaller as it gets to Earth?
    
    Test and save. Your spaceship should get smaller as it moves. Test your spaceship a **second time**. Is it the right size when it starts?

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- Your spaceship should start at **100% size**, and then **change size** by a small amount as it moves. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here is the code blocks you'll need: ![Blocks for changing size](images/space-size-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here's the code to change your spaceship's size as it moves: ![Code for changing size](images/space-size-code.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---
