Can you add code to your monkey sprite so that it spins slowly in a circle forever?

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \---

When the green **flag is clicked**, your monkey sprite should **turn** in a circle **forever**.

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \---

Here are the code blocks you need:

```blocks3

end

turn cw (15) degrees

when flag clicked
```
