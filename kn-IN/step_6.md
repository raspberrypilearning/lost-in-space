Can you add code for your rock sprite so that the rock bounces around the stage?

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \---

When the green **flag is clicked**, your rock sprite should **move** and **bounce** around the stage **forever**.

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \---

Here are the code blocks you need:

```blocks3
move (10) steps

if on edge bounce

when flag clicked

forever
```

You can also set a more interesting starting direction for the rock sprite with one of these blocks:

```blocks3
turn cw (15) degrees

point towards (Earth v)
```

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \---

Here's the code for making your rock bounce around the stage:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
point towards (Earth v)
forever
    move (2) steps
    if on edge, bounce
```
