## Animation using loops

Another way to animate the spaceship is to tell it to move a small amount many times

\--- task \---

Delete the `glide`{:class="block3motion"} block from your code. To do this, drag the block off the Code area and drop it back where the other single code blocks are.

![Spaceship sprite](images/sprite-spaceship.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
point in direction (0)
go to x:(-150) y:(-150)
say [Let's go] for (2) seconds
point towards (Earth v)

- glide (1) secs to x:(0) y:(0)
```

\--- /task \---

\--- task \---

Now use a `repeat`{:class="block3control"} block to move your spaceship towards the Earth?

![Spaceship sprite](images/sprite-spaceship.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
point in direction (0)
go to x:(-150) y:(-150)
say [Let's go] for (2) seconds
point towards (Earth v)

+ repeat (200)
    move (2) steps
```

Test and save your code. Your spaceship should move towards the Earth exactly as before, but this time it uses a `repeat`{:class="block3control"} block.

\--- /task \---

\--- task \---

Next add code to your spaceship sprite so that the spaceship changes colour as it moves towards Earth?

Use this block:

![Spaceship sprite](images/sprite-spaceship.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
point in direction (0)
go to x:(-150) y:(-150)
say [Let's go] for (2) seconds
point towards (Earth v)
repeat (200)
    move (2) steps

+    change [color v] effect by (25)
```

Test and save your code.

Can you make your spaceship get smaller as it moves towards Earth?

\--- hints \---

\--- hint \---

Your spaceship should start at `100% size`{:class="blocklooks"}, and then `change size`{:class="blocklooks"} by a small amount each time it moves.

\--- /hint \---

\--- hint \---

You will need to add these blocks to your code:

![Spaceship sprite](images/sprite-spaceship.png)

```blocks3
change size by (10)

set size to (100) %
```

\--- /hint \---

\--- hint \---

Your code should look like this:

![Spaceship sprite](images/sprite-spaceship.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
set size to (100) %
point in direction (0)
go to x:(-150) y:(-150)
say [Let's go] for (2) seconds
point towards (Earth v)
repeat (200)
    move (2) steps
    change [color v] effect by (25)

+   change size by (-3)
```

\--- /hint \---

\--- /hints \---

\--- /task \---

Test and save your code. Your spaceship should now get smaller as it moves. Test your spaceship a **second time**. Is it the right size when it starts?
