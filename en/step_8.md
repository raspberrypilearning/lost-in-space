## What next?

Try the [Ghostbusters](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/ghostbusters?utm_source=pathway&utm_medium=whatnext&utm_campaign=projects) project! In that project, you will learn how to create a game with ghosts that appear all over the place and that you need to catch. You will also learn how to add a timer and a score to the game, so that you can see how many ghosts you are able to catch.
