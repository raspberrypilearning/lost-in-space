## Animation using loops

Another way to animate the spaceship is to tell it to move a small amount many times

--- task ---
Delete the `glide`{:class="block3motion"} block from your code. To do this, drag the block off the Code area and drop it back where the other single code blocks are.

Can you use a `repeat`{:class="block3control"} block to move your spaceship towards the Earth?

Instead of __gliding__, your spaceship should __repeatedly__ __move__ a few steps at a time.

Here are the code blocks you need:

Here is the code to animate your spaceship:

You can use different numbers in the `repeat`{:class="block3control"} and `move`{:class="block3motion"} blocks, as long as the spaceship still gets to Earth!

Test and save your code. Your spaceship should move towards the Earth exactly as before, but this time it uses a `repeat`{:class="block3control"} block.

Can you add code to your spaceship sprite so that the spaceship changes colour as it moves towards Earth?

Use this block:

![Spaceship sprite](images/sprite-spaceship.png)
![blocks_1545292613_2487206](images/blocks_1545292613_2487206.png)

Test and save your code.

Can you make your spaceship get smaller as it moves towards Earth?

Your spaceship should start at __100% size__, and then __change size__ by a small amount each time it moves.

Use these blocks:

![Spaceship sprite](images/sprite-spaceship.png)
![blocks_1545292614_335848](images/blocks_1545292614_335848.png)
--- /task ---

Test and save your code. Your spaceship should now get smaller as it moves. Test your spaceship a __second time__. Is it the right size when it starts?
