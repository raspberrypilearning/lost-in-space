## Floating monkey

Now you will add a monkey who's lost in space to your animation!

--- task ---

Start by adding the 'monkey' sprite from the library.

![The image features a cartoon-style space scene with a playful monkey character and a rocket. The background is a dark, starry sky. The monkey, standing upright with arms outstretched, has a cheerful expression and is positioned near the center of the image. Below and to the left, a purple and red rocket emits yellow flames and white smoke, angled diagonally upward as if in motion. On the upper right, a depiction of planet Earth is visible, showing green landmasses and blue oceans, adding context to the space exploration theme.](images/space-monkey-sprite.png)

Set the fill to be transparent by selecting the red line. For the outline, set a white colour by moving the Saturation slider to `0` and the Brightness slider to `100`.

![The image shows a color selection tool interface from a design or editing platform. It displays options for adjusting the color, saturation, and brightness. The selected color is currently purple, indicated by a color slider with a saturation setting at "0" and a brightness setting at "100," making the color appear white. The interface also includes an eyedropper tool and an option to select or clear colors. The layout suggests functionality for customizing fill and outline colors for design elements.](images/make-white.png)

Click on the **circle** tool and then use it to draw a white space helmet around the monkey's head.

![The image shows the Scratch costume editor with a cartoon monkey character being edited. The monkey, with a cheerful expression and light brown fur, is positioned in the center on a transparent grid background. Blue handles surround the monkey's head, indicating that it is being adjusted or resized. On the left, a toolbar displays editing tools such as selection, brush, text, and shapes. The outline color is set to orange, as seen in the toolbar above. A "Convert to Bitmap" button is located at the bottom left, and zoom controls are visible in the bottom right corner.](images/space-monkey-edit.png)

The monkey is tilted diagonally, suggesting motion or rotation, and it has a cheerful expression. A faint outline of a space helmet is visible around its head, for space exploration. The playful and dynamic positioning creates a sense of movement in the zero-gravity environment.](images/space-spin-test.png)
