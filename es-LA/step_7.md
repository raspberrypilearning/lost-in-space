Can you add code to your star sprite to make the star repeatedly grow and shrink?

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \---

When the green **flag is clicked**, your star sprite should **change size** to get bigger a few times, and then **change size** to get smaller a few times. It should do this so that it gets bigger and then smaller **forever** and looks like it's shining light.

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \---

Here are the code blocks you need:

```blocks3
repeat (10)
end

when flag clicked

repeat (10)
end

change size by (10)

change size by (10)

forever
```

Here's the code to make your star grow and shrink:

![Star sprite](images/sprite-star.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
    repeat (20)
        change size by (2)
    end
    repeat (20)
        change size by (-2)
    end

```
