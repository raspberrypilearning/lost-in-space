Add this code to your spaceship sprite:

![Spaceship sprite](images/sprite-spaceship.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
point in direction (0)
go to x:(-150) y:(-150)
say [Let's go] for (2) seconds
point towards (Earth v)
glide (1) secs to x:(0) y:(0)
```

Change the numbers in the code blocks you've added so that the code is exactly the same as above.

\--- /task \---

If you click the green flag, you should see the spaceship speak, turn, and glide towards the centre of the stage.
