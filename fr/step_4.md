## Step 2: Animating using loops

Another way to animate the spaceship is to tell it to move a small amount lots of times.

+ Delete the `glide` block from your code by right-clicking on it and clicking **delete**. You can also delete code by dragging it off the Script area and back into the Code blocks area.

+ Can you use a `repeat` block to move your spaceship towards the Earth?
    
    Test and save: Your spaceship should move towards the Earth exactly as before, this time using a `repeat` block.

+ Can you code your spaceship to change colour as it moves towards Earth?
    
    Test and save.

+ Can you make your spaceship get smaller as it gets to Earth?
    
    Test and save. Your spaceship should get smaller as it moves. Test your spaceship a **second time**. Is it the right size when it starts?
